# Notes:
# Orthophotos (2025-04-01):
# There seem to be no good orthophotos for Field 3 and the first set of parcels.
# All the acquited orthophotos are from the spring, unless otherwise stated.
# At this point I will omit the orthophotos from the analysis and focus on other
# variables.

# DUALEM (2025-04-01):
# The DUALEM measurements for the parcels will need to be divided into the
# separate output files for the different fields.
# For interpolation, use DUALEM1 AUX4 (PRP), effective depth 30 cm, DOE 50 cm.
# There are no half meter measurements from Vindum, so I will stick with 1 m.
# NB: The layer and variable names are different for the Vindum point file.
